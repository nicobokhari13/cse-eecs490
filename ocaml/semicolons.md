# Single vs. Double Semicolons in OCaml

In OCaml, `;` and `;;` are both used as separators, but they serve different purposes and are used in distinct contexts:

### 1. **Semicolon (`;`)** – Statement Separator

The semicolon (`;`) is used to separate **statements** (expressions that have side effects) within a block of code or inside a function. It allows you to execute multiple expressions sequentially, where the result of one expression might be used for side effects, and the next expression continues the flow.

#### Example: Sequential Statements
```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let _ = print_int x in    (* print the value of x *)
let y = x + 1 in
print_int y;;             (* print the value of y *)
```

Here:
- `let _ = print_int x in` runs the side effect of printing `x`, but doesn't return a usable value.
- The semicolons separate the statements.

You **do not use `;` to terminate the last expression** in a sequence, it is only used to separate side-effecting expressions.

### 2. **Double Semicolon (`;;`)** – End of Top-Level Expression (or Script)

The double semicolon (`;;`) is used to **terminate top-level expressions**, particularly in **interactive** mode (like in `utop` or the OCaml REPL) or when you write scripts that are meant to be executed.

The double semicolon signals to the interpreter or the compiler that you are done with the current expression and are ready to evaluate or interpret it.

#### Example: Top-Level Expression
```ocaml
let x = 10;;  (* Define x at the top level *)
let y = 20;;  (* Define y at the top level *)
```

In interactive mode, the `;;` allows you to separate distinct expressions so that each one can be processed independently. It is especially useful when defining multiple values or functions at the top level.

### Difference Summary

- **`;`**: Used to separate **statements** in sequences or in expressions where side effects occur (e.g., assignments, function calls).
  - **Example**: `a := 42; print_int !a;`
  
- **`;;`**: Used to terminate a **top-level expression**, especially in interactive mode or in a script.
  - **Example**: `let x = 10;;`

### When to Use Each:
- **Use `;`** when you want to chain **statements** with side effects, especially inside functions, `let` bindings, or `match` expressions.
- **Use `;;`** when you want to signal the **end of a top-level expression** or in interactive OCaml environments. It is not needed in actual OCaml code (in `.ml` files) for defining functions or values, as the compiler knows where the top-level expression ends.

### Example in Context:

Here’s an example that demonstrates both:

```ocaml
let f () = 
  let _ = print_string "Hello" in
  let _ = print_string " " in
  let _ = print_string "world!" in
  ();;  (* Terminate the top-level function definition *)

f ();;  (* Call the function with a double semicolon to execute it in the top-level environment *)
```

In this example:
- `;` is used to separate the side-effecting statements within the function `f ()`.
- `;;` is used to terminate the top-level expression when defining and invoking the function in an interactive OCaml session.
