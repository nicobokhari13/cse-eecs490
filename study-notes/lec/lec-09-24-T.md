Typing Rules for Functions via Simply Typed Calculus

* All functions follow definition (Tin -> Tout)
  * Types preserved regardless of how function arguments are constructed
  * Functions are applied (**a.k.a Elimination Form**)


## Type Safety

Defined by: 

* Typing Preservation 
  * If a typing context *is empty*, and a typed expression evaluates to a value, then the typing context entails the value is the same type
  * Cannot assume for all typing contexts since free variables can be introduced
* Typing Progress
  * No undefined behavior
  * If a typing context is empty, and there is a typed expression, then either the expression is a value or evaluates to some value

## Implementing Type Checker


### Type Analyzer

An operation that takes in some 
* typing context
* expression
* proposed type
and outputs whether the expression derives/evaluates to the proposed type (i.e True/False)

**Correctness/Soundness Theorem:**
```
if analyzer(context, expresssion, type); then: 
  the context asserts that the expression holds that type
else:
  typing error on the expression
```

**Completeness Theorem**
```
if the typing context asserts that an expression has some type; then
  the analyzer will evalaute the expression to that type
```
### Type Synthesizer

An operation that takes in some
* typing context
* expression
and output an type option that the expression would derive. 

**Soundness Theorem**
```
If synth(context, expression) = type.option ; then
  the context asserts the overall type on the expression
```

NOTE: SYNTHESIZER DOES NOT FOLLOW COMPLETENESS

Thus -> **Solution for Completeness Theorem**
* Require type annotations on function arguments
* All expressions will exhibit some unique Type
```python

# Example: 
fun x: type_in -> type_out 
fun x: type_in -> e: expression
# since functions are defined by some expression,
# e:expression must exhibit type_out

```

### Type Inference

Given some constraints defined in expressions (via type annotations), 
many types can be inferred 

**Function Typing**

-> syntax used in defining functions

```python

# Recall: Currying

let y = 
  fun m:Num -> 
    fun x:Num -> 
      fun b:Num -> m * x + b: Num -> (Num -> (Num -> Num)) # m(x(b))

```

NOTE: -> IS RIGHT ASSOCIATIVE

## Product Types

Groups valued into compound types (pairs, tuples)
