# what is functional programming #
# - programming with pure mathematical expression#

# 2 * 3 + 4 #
# * and + are operators #
# expressions are composed with numbers + operators#
# for example: the + operator works on the (2 * 3) subexpression and (4) subexpression #

# Variables are given meaning subsctitution #
# they are not IMPERATIVE variables#

let x = 5 * 2 in 
x + x + 2 * x  #using x twice in this expression #
# notice operations substitution and variable lookup #
# notice : x is evaluated (i.e "eager evaluation"), then performs #

# let expressions can be composed inside other expressions#
